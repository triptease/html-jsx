# Things to do

1. Content categories cannot be enforced at compile time, however, at run time they can. Look at logging warnings and 
   behaving differently in dev and prod. 
2. Look at jsx dev options
3. Look at using https://github.com/markuplint/markuplint/tree/main/packages/%40markuplint/html-spec
2. Modularise the generation to make it easier to read
